Over-engineering will always cause you trouble, many trouble, but I'll just focus on one today : performance.
I've stopped counting how many times I've encountered overlooked endpoints that were just the way they were, but after taking a deeper look and a stupid fix I've literally changed user's perspective of an app from slow to blazing fast.
Many of those times, over-engineering was the culript. An hashmap loading a ton of data in RAM before some heavy treatment for no good reason, an enormous payload returned from the API when only a fraction would have worked... pick your poison.

<u>Stop expecting things that never happen.</u> You're not Google, OpenAI or Anthropic. You're you. Build for yourself. Build for today, adapt tomorrow.

This will avoid having those ridiculous charts :

<OptimizedImage src="/images/blog/hashmapfix_ram_chart.png" alt="RAM Chart" caption="Memory usage before and after the fix" width={800} height={400} />

or this one :
