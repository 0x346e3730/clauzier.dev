# CDN and Performance Optimization Recommendations

## Current Setup Analysis
- **Static Hosting**: Caddy server serving static files
- **Compression**: Gzip, Brotli, and Zstandard enabled
- **Caching**: Aggressive HTTP caching with immutable assets
- **Image Optimization**: Astro built-in with Sharp

## Recommended CDN Solutions

### 1. Cloudflare (Recommended)
**Why**: Best balance of performance, features, and cost

**Setup**:
```bash
# Add to DNS
clauzier.dev -> Cloudflare -> Your server
```

**Configuration**:
- Enable "Always Use HTTPS"
- Set caching level to "Standard" 
- Enable Brotli compression
- Use Page Rules for fine-grained caching
- Enable "Auto Minify" for CSS/JS/HTML

**Estimated Cost**: Free tier suitable for personal sites

### 2. AWS CloudFront + S3
**Why**: Enterprise-grade with excellent global coverage

**Setup**:
1. Upload static files to S3 bucket
2. Create CloudFront distribution
3. Configure custom domain and SSL

**Estimated Cost**: ~$1-5/month for personal site traffic

### 3. Vercel (Alternative hosting + CDN)
**Why**: Zero-config deployment with excellent performance

**Migration**:
```bash
# Deploy to Vercel instead of self-hosting
npm i -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

**Benefits**:
- Automatic image optimization
- Edge functions for dynamic content
- Built-in analytics

## Image CDN Recommendations

### 1. Cloudinary (Recommended for images)
**Features**:
- Automatic format optimization (WebP/AVIF)
- On-the-fly resizing and cropping
- AI-powered optimization

**Integration**:
```javascript
// Update imageOptimization.ts
export function getCDNUrl(src, transformations) {
  const baseUrl = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/your-cloud/image/fetch';
  const params = Object.entries(transformations)
    .map(([key, value]) => `${key}_${value}`)
    .join(',');
  return `${baseUrl}/${params}/${encodeURIComponent(src)}`;
}
```

### 2. ImageKit
**Features**:
- Real-time image optimization
- WebP/AVIF support
- Global CDN delivery

### 3. Astro's Built-in + CDN
**Current approach**: Keep Astro's optimization + serve via CDN
- Pro: No additional image processing costs
- Con: Less flexible than dedicated image CDN

## Performance Optimization Stack

### Recommended Architecture:
```

    ↓
Cloudflare CDN (Edge caching)
    ↓
Your Server (Caddy + Static files)
    ↓
Images: Cloudinary/ImageKit
```

### Implementation Priority:

#### Phase 1 (Immediate - Free):
1. **Cloudflare Setup**
   - Add site to Cloudflare
   - Configure DNS
   - Enable caching and compression
   - Set up page rules

#### Phase 2 (1-2 weeks):
2. **Image CDN Integration**
   - Sign up for Cloudinary free tier
   - Update OptimizedImage component
   - Migrate existing images

#### Phase 3 (Optional):
3. **Advanced Optimizations**
   - Worker scripts for edge logic
   - Advanced caching strategies
   - Performance monitoring

## Expected Performance Gains

### Before CDN:
- TTFB: 200-500ms (depending on server location)
- Image loading: 1-3s for high-res images
- Global latency: 50-2000ms

### After CDN Implementation:
- TTFB: 50-150ms (edge caching)
- Image loading: 200-800ms (optimized + cached)
- Global latency: 20-100ms

### Lighthouse Score Improvements:
- Performance: +15-25 points
- Largest Contentful Paint: -40-60% reduction
- First Contentful Paint: -30-50% reduction

## Cost Analysis

### Free Tier Limits:
- **Cloudflare**: 100,000 requests/month
- **Cloudinary**: 25 credits/month (enough for personal site)
- **Total**: $0/month for typical personal site traffic

### Paid Tiers (if needed):
- **Cloudflare Pro**: $20/month (unnecessary for personal sites)
- **Cloudinary**: $89/month (only if exceeding free tier significantly)

## Implementation Checklist

### Cloudflare Setup:
- [ ] Create Cloudflare account
- [ ] Add clauzier.dev domain
- [ ] Update nameservers
- [ ] Configure caching rules
- [ ] Enable security features
- [ ] Test performance improvements

### Image CDN Setup:
- [ ] Sign up for image CDN service
- [ ] Update image component
- [ ] Test image optimization
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics

### Monitoring:
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Configure alerting for downtime
- [ ] Regular performance audits

## Alternative: Self-hosted Optimizations

If preferring to keep current setup:

### Additional Nginx/Caddy Optimizations:
```nginx
# Enable additional compression
gzip_vary on;
gzip_types text/css application/javascript image/svg+xml;

# Add cache headers for specific file types
location ~* \.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|ico|svg)$ {
    expires 1y;
    add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
}
```

### Docker Multi-stage Build Improvements:
```dockerfile
# Add image optimization in build stage
FROM node:alpine as optimizer
WORKDIR /app
COPY public/images ./images
RUN npm install -g imagemin-cli imagemin-webp imagemin-avif
RUN imagemin images/*.{jpg,png} --out-dir=optimized --plugin=webp
```

This comprehensive approach will significantly improve your site's performance while maintaining cost-effectiveness.
